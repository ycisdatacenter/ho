      fullText: `Padma Bhushan Dr. Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil, a great educationist, started Rayat Shikshan Sanstha in 1919 to provide education to poor and underprivileged children living in rural areas. Since then, the institution has always focused not just on increasing the number of students but also on improving the quality of education. To achieve this, Rayat Sanstha has provided good facilities and skilled teachers. At the school level, various programs like Gurukul projects, computer labs, science labs, competitive exam coaching, and English speaking classes help students become talented and confident. In colleges, along with regular courses, skill-based programs are also offered to make students independent and job-ready. Rayat Sanstha is one of the leading institutions implementing the National Education Policy 2020 effectively.
This year, the institution has made special efforts in education by understanding the needs of students and society. As a result, students have achieved success in competitive exams and sports, which is truly impressive.
Under the leadership of Hon. MP Sharad Pawar, the institution is progressing well in all areas. The Vice Presidents Mrs. Jayashree Chougule, Mr. Arun Kadu-Patil, Mr. P.J. Patil, Mr. Mahendra Lad, and Adv. Ram Kandage, Vice Chairman Adv. Bhagirath Shinde, Organizer Dr. Anil Patil, department heads, managing council members, and other members have all given valuable support for the institution’s development.
Our Secretary Mr. Vikas Deshmukh, Joint Secretaries Principal Dr. Shivling Menkudale, Mr. B.N. Pawar, and Principal Dr. Rajendra More are working hard for the progress of the Sanstha. Their contribution is very important.
I also thank all officers, teachers, professors, well-wishers, parents, and students for their constant support.
With this, I end my message.
Thank you!`,
